MESA and GYRE `inlists` for modelling Population III stars in "Evolution of Low-Mass Population III Stars: Convection, Mass Loss, Nucleosynthesis, and Neutrinos" (Paper I) and "Red-Giant Asteroseismology of Low-Mass Population III Stars" (Paper II) by Ferreira et al. (2026, submitted to AAS Journals) | MESA version r24.08.1, MESA SDK version 24.7.1, and GYRE version 7.1.

Notes:

- The `inlists` in **PopIII.zip** (main project) and **PopI.zip** are used in both Papers I and II, specifically in Section 3.2, "Metallicity-Driven Structural Evolution", of Paper I, and in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, "The Main Sequence" and "Subgiants and Red Giants", of Paper II.
- The `inlists` in **PopIII_Accretion.zip** are used in Section 4.2, "Seismic Signatures of Interstellar Accretion onto Pop III Stars", of Paper II, whilst those in **PopI_Stripping.zip** are used in Section 4.3, "Seismic Signatures of Envelope Stripping in High-Metallicity Stellar Models", also in Paper II.
